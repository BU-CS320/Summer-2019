## REPL hints
* `:load` or `:l` will change the module you are inspecting
* `:reload` or `:r` will reload the file.  Do this often!
* `:type` or `:t` will tell you the type of an expression
* `:quit` or `:q` will leave the repl

* To enter more than one line in the REPL, use `:{` and `:}`, as shown here:
```
Prelude> :{
Prelude| f :: Integer -> Integer
Prelude| f x = x
Prelude| :}
Prelude>
```
