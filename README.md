## REPL hints
* `:load` or `:l` will change the module you are inspecting
* `:reload` or `:r` will reload the file.  Do this often!
* `:type` or `:t` will tell you the type of an expression
* `:quit` or `:q` will leave the repl

* To enter more than one line in the REPL, use :{ and :}, as shown here:
<pre>
  Prelude> :{
  Prelude| f :: Integer -> Integer
  Prelude| f x = x
  Prelude| :}
  Prelude>
</pre>
## ```git``` issues
If you are having ```git``` issues, run ```git status``` and cut and paste it into a private message on GitHub for Mark.
